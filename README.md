## **Overall description** 
- This repository contains the codebase and datasets for the AKG-NSA project, which is associated with our research paper titled "Lightweight yet Secure: Archive Knowledge Graph-enhanced Native Sparse Attention Network for Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Recommendation". The code provided here is exclusively for the purpose of peer review.
## **Code description** 
### **Implementation details**
We implemented AKG-NSA with TensorFlow and accelerated the model training using an Intel® Xeon® Silver 4210 CPU @ 2.20GHz CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24G) GPU. The operating system is Ubuntu 22.04, the system memory is 126G, and the coding platform is Pycharm.
